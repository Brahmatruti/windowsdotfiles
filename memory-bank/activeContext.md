# Active Context

## Current Work Focus

We are initializing the memory bank for the windowsdotfiles repository, which contains dotfiles and setup scripts for Microsoft Windows 11. This repository automates the configuration of a development environment, ensuring consistency and reducing setup time across reboots and systems.

## Recent Changes

- Created projectbrief.md to define core requirements and goals.
- Created productContext.md to document the project's purpose, problems it solves, and user experience goals.
- Created systemPatterns.md to outline architecture and design patterns for repeatable setups.
- Created techContext.md to list technologies used, such as PowerShell, Chocolatey, Docker, and WSL.

## Next Steps

- Create progress.md to track current status and remaining tasks.
- Refine and expand the memory bank files based on ongoing work.
- Initialize the memory bank for other repositories if required.

## Active Decisions and Considerations

- Use PowerShell-based automation for system configuration to ensure resilience.
- Prioritize version control and semantic versioning for dependency management.
- Employ modular setup patterns to separate concerns into distinct categories like automation, configuration management, and development tools.
- Favor clear documentation and standardized practices for team collaboration and automation.

## Important Patterns and Preferences

- Infrastructure-as-Code approach with configuration files for consistency.
- Environment-specific settings managed through version control.
- Automation scripts like setup.ps1 for comprehensive environment initialization.

## Learnings and Project Insights

- Automated setups can significantly reduce configuration time but require thorough documentation.
- Memory bank pattern ensures knowledge retention during system resets, improving efficiency in long-term maintenance.
- Early automation decisions save time by minimizing manual interventions in development workflows.
