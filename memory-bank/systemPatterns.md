# System Architecture Patterns

This repository utilizes a modular architecture with the following patterns to ensure repeatable and resilient Windows 11 configurations:

1. **Automation Pattern**

   - PowerShell-based automation for system setup and configuration
   - Use of scripts like setup.ps1 for comprehensive environment initialization
   - Infrastructure-as-Code approach with configuration files for consistency

2. **Configuration Management**

   - Environment-specific settings managed through configuration files
   - .editorconfig for consistent coding style across different editors
   - Version control of all configuration files to track changes and ensure reproducibility

3. **Modular Setup Pattern**

   - Separation of concerns into distinct categories (e.g., Chocolatey, Docker, WSL, PowerShell)
   - Each module handles specific aspects of the environment setup
   - Clear dependencies between modules for streamlined execution

4. **Version Control Strategy**

   - Semantic versioning for managing tool dependencies
   - Automated dependency updates using Chocolatey and other package managers
   - Branching model for testing new configurations before deployment

5. **Resilience Pattern**
   - Symbolic links and hidden files for persistent configuration
   - Backup and restore mechanisms for critical settings
   - Automated system updates and maintenance scripts

This architecture enables a repeatable setup process that maintains consistency across reboots and different Windows 11 systems.
